### INTRODUCTION
- This manual contains a step-by-step guide for Velas node setup.
- All active nodes are candidates, currently, 19 validators are chosen per epoch, based on the list of candidates.
- When a node is chosen as a validator, it and all its delegates will receive a reward (staking) at the end of the epoch.
- Balance, uptime, stability, or computer power are some of the parameters that the Velas AI analyzes to decide who will be the next validators in the network.
 
 - Any user on the Velas network can configure and run a node.
