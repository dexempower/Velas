## INTRODUCTION

*Before starting the recovery process, you should keep these points in mind*

- Velas' support team will NEVER ask your seed words.

- The restoration process allows you to access the funds using our seed words.

- Every time you restore your Velas Wallet we can set up a different PIN/Password to protect the device locally.

- You are the only one who knows your seed words, if you have lost them nobody can provide it.

- Try to keep your device protected, by providing antivirus and run analysis periodically to keep it safe and secure on your computer.



## RESTORING ACCOUNT

 **Enter Your Seed**
 
 - ![](https://github.com/dexempower/dexempower.github.io-velas/blob/main/assets/logos/CautionLogo.png?raw=true)&nbsp; Enter your seed word by word, **don ÃÅt rush it and double-check your inputs to ensure that the order of the words and the spelling is accurate and  correct.** For security reasons, you will be asked to enter the words randomly, it 
 always marks by a number to indicating which words are the ones you have to enter.
