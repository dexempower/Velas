```

## INTRODUCTION

*Before starting the recovery process, you should keep these points in mind*

- Velas' support team will NEVER ask your seed words.

- The restoration process allows you to access the funds using our seed words.

- Every time you restore your Velas Wallet we can set up a different PIN/Password to protect the device locally.

- You are the only one who knows your seed words, if you have lost them nobody can provide it.

- Try to keep your device protected, by providing antivirus and run analysis periodically to keep it safe and secure on your computer.



## RESTORING ACCOUNT
